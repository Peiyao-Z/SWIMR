Description: The SWIMR (Spatially Weighted Integration for Multi-Reference deconvolution) package is a statistical framework designed to accurately determine cell type composition in spatial transcriptomics data. It models gene expression at each spatial location as a weighted combination of multiple reference datasets, where both cell type proportions and reference weights can vary across the tissue.
